    We trace our roots to the present Cathedral of St. Thomas at Fort, where in 1718, Rev. Richard Cobbe,<br>
    Chaplain to the East India Company’s Factory at Bombay, founded not far from the Cathedral, in 1718,<br>
    a small free school, where twelve poor boys were housed, clothed, fed and educated by just one master.
    <br>
    This Charity school, was the grain of mustard seed from which Christ Church School,<br>
    Byculla and Barnes School & Junior College, Devlali have sprung into mighty trees.<br>

    Christ Church School has been familiar territory for most of us Principals of Anglo Indian<br> Schools in
    Maharashtra.<br>
    We have always enjoyed our meetings hosted by the Late Mr Carl Laurie Hon. Secretary <br>and treasurer of the Anglo
    Indian heads association Maharashtra.
    <br>
    Taking up the mantle of principal CCS with Mr Laurie’s blessings makes my role special.
    <br>
    It would be my endeavour to uphold the traditions, culture, ethos and values of this great<br> institution and to
    ensure
    that this legacy is carried forth.
    <br>
    We also believe in holistic education which ensures that learners are exposed to a <br>programme that will develop
    their
    mind, body and soul helping students become confident,<br> responsible, reflective, innovative and engaged, ready to
    tackle the demands of <br>tomorrow’s world and capable of
    shaping a better world for the future. <br>
    As a school for the future – we believe our children will be able to face our ever changing<br> world thus helping
    them
    grow up to be global citizens with humanitarian values.
    <br>
    CCS will continue to grow keeping in mind the demands of a good education in a new world.<br> Here the pressure to
    deliver has never dulled our passion to explore and chart new territory.

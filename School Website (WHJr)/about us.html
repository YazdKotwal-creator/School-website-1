    We trace our roots to the present Cathedral of St. Thomas at Fort, where in 1718, Rev. Richard Cobbe,
    Chaplain to the East India Company’s Factory at Bombay, founded not far from the Cathedral, in 1718,
    a small free school, where twelve poor boys were housed, clothed, fed and educated by just one master.
    This Charity school, was the grain of mustard seed from which Christ Church School,
    Byculla and Barnes School & Junior College, Devlali have sprung into mighty trees.
    Christ Church School has been familiar territory for most of us Principals of Anglo Indian Schools in
    Maharashtra.<br><br>

    We have always enjoyed our meetings hosted by the Late Mr Carl Laurie Hon. Secretary and treasurer of the Anglo
    Indian heads association Maharashtra.
    
    Taking up the mantle of principal CCS with Mr Laurie’s blessings makes my role special.
    
    It would be my endeavour to uphold the traditions, culture, ethos and values of this great institution and to
    ensure that this legacy is carried forth.
    We also believe in holistic education which ensures that learners are exposed to a programme that will develop
    their
    mind, body and soul helping students become confident, responsible, reflective, innovative and engaged, ready to
    tackle the demands of tomorrow’s world and capable of
    shaping a better world for the future. As a school for the future – we believe our children will be able to face our ever changing world thus helping
    them grow up to be global citizens with humanitarian values.
    CCS will continue to grow keeping in mind the demands of a good education in a new world.Here the pressure to
    deliver has never dulled our passion to explore and chart new territory.

  Admission Process<br>
  The admission process is simple and transparent. It works on the belief that a personal interaction between
  parents/authorised guardians, the prospective student and the school’s authorised representatives is of far greater
  value than any conventional admission test. The process is aimed at giving us an insight into the type of education
  approach and environment you believe would be appropriate for your child to maximise his/her potential, while giving
  us a glimpse of the child’s strengths, learning needs and potential. It also gives you, as parents/authorised
  guardians, a first-hand opportunity to obtain an understanding of how our students and faculty engage with each other,
  our overall offering, curricula and our educational approach.<br>
  <br>
  PLEASE NOTE:<br>
  Pre School and Primary school placements will be based on interactions with and recommendations by the Grade Teacher
  and/or Special Educator for that specific grade.<br>
  <br>
  Entrance to Grades 6 to 12: Students will go through a short placement test in specific subjects like English,
  Mathematics and Science, aimed at evaluating grade appropriate academic competence.<br>
  <br>
  Applicants for Grade 11 may be granted admission based on marks obtained in the Grade 10 Board Examination. However,
  the School reserves the right to administer a placement test, depending on the choice of board, marks obtained and
  subjects opted for.<br>
  <br>
  Admission in Grades 10 & 12 is very rare.<br>
  <br>
